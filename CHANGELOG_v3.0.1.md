# Changelog v3.0.1 – English documentation refresh

## Summary
- README rewritten entirely in English while keeping the original structure and usage details.
- `kubelet_auto_config.sh` output, comments, and help text translated to English; log messages now match the README terminology.
- `rollback-kubelet-config.sh` already exposed English output, no functional change required.
- Internal version bumped to **3.0.1** to track the documentation-only release.

## Notes
- No behavioural changes were introduced; this release is documentation/localisation only.
- Scripts remain compatible with Kubernetes v1.26+ and the guidance described in earlier versions.
